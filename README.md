# quantum-maxcut-IonQ-Challenge
A quantum computing implementation for graph optimization problems using IonQ's QITE algorithm. Developed during iQuHack 2025 at MIT, this repository contains custom quantum circuits and Hamiltonians for solving max-cut and node distribution problems on various graph structures, including the Petersen graph.
